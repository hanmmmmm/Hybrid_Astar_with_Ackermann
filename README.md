# Hybrid_Astar_with_Ackermann

This project is my implementation of a navigation package, including the Hybrid A* planner and pure pursuit controller. Also it has a basic simulator for an ackermann robot (using bicycle model). This simulator has only the calculation parts. The visulization happens in RVIZ. 

My implementation of Hybrid A* has the incremental searching and Reeds Shepp curve searching. This generates acceptable reaults. 
 I tried an approach of using numerical optimiztion to improve the curve to be more 

Every code in this project was developed by myself using standard C++ and ROS tools. 

It was developed and tested in ROS Noetic.
