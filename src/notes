for optimization:
- change angle calc from random float to pre-calc ints

- Mem. path plan node use over 200MB ram. Could be reduced.


for presentation:
- run pure pursuit example paths in rviz, (maunal paths)
- measure speed, eg. (xx ms per 1M search)




TODO:

Mar 29 2024
- path-validation:
-- create a new function: bool validate(){}
-- add the mechnism in planner to trigger by validate().

- simulaion:
-- add randomness in states
--- Done.  Apr 1

-- Mem usage keeps increasing over time. 
--- Might change car-shape msg type from marker to Path or geometry_msgs/PolygonStamped.h.
--- after some testing, the lagging and memory issue seem to caused by the Marker msg. 
--- the reason was the msg points vector was not cleared in loop, so it's always growing.
--- Fixed. Apr 1



idea for future:


-add trajectory optimization:
-- (Might not worth doing this one, because TEB is implemented in ROS, and it works well.)
-- the intial waypoints are the points from existing result
-- start annd end pose are fixed
-- will need a way to define the cost when close to the occupied grids
