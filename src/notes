for optimization:
- change angle calc from random float to pre-calc ints



for presentation:
- run pure pursuit example paths in rviz, (maunal paths)
- measure speed, eg. (xx ms per 1M search)




TODO:

Mar 29 2024
- path-validation:
-- create a new function: bool validate(){}
-- add the mechnism in planner to trigger by validate().

- simulaion:
-- add randomness in states


future:

(Might not worth doing this one, because TEB is implemented in ROS, and it works well.)
add trajectory optimization:
- the intial waypoints are the points from existing result
- start annd end pose are fixed
- will need a way to define the cost when close to the occupied grids
